### ironhack DAFT midbootcamp project
### Rayan Hawili


## Project Intro & Objective
This project is a part of the Data Analystics bootcamp for the October 2020 cohort at [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/en/data-analytics).
in which we take on the role of an analyst for a real estate company taksed in:
- building a [machine learning model] to predict the selling prics of house in the state of Washington (US) based on features on which the value of the house is evaluated
- creating [dashboards](https://github.com/ironhack-daft-ray/midterm_project/blob/main/outputs/tableau_task/RH_midterm_tableau.twb) and [scripts](https://github.com/ironhack-daft-ray/midterm_project/blob/main/outputs/sql_task/RH_midterm_SQL.sql) for the management team to quickly retrieve data regarding the company's real estate portfolio and performance


## Methodology

### Predictive Model:
* Model built upon Python and inferential statistics
* Data retrieval - cleaning - preprocessing
* Multicollinearity checks
* Train Test split (60/40)
* Linear Regression Analysis
* Adjusted R-squared Accuracy checks

### Dashboard:
* Data Visualization using Tableau
* Dashboards based on specific requets from manangement

### Scripts:
* Data retrieval and manipulation using MySQL
* Script based on specific requests from management


## Potential next steps:
* Fine tuning the predictive model and/or comparing it to alternative models


## Featured Outputs
